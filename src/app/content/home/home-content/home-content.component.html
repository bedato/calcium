    <p class="text-base">
        CalciumUI has a collection of barebones UI components which are styled by TailwindCSS. The styling is pretty
        bare bones. That's why it's called Calcium.
        Point of this collection is to have a ready to use fully customisable UI library which is not locked
        behind
        obscurity or bundled files, inspired by shadcn/ui.

        The goal here is not to have a fully flexible component library to the extend like shadcn, but UI
        Elements
        you
        can grab as base for quick prototyping or UI component building.
